    <h1>Callback functions</h1>
    <p>
      A JavaScript callback is a function which is to be executed after another
      function has finished execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Callbacks allow you to continue executing code while the operation is
      being executed in the background
    </p>
    <pre>
        We’ll write a function ask(question, yes, no) with three parameters:

        question
        Text of the question

        yes
        Function to run if the answer is “Yes”

        no
        Function to run if the answer is “No”

        The function should ask the question and, depending on the user’s answer, call yes() or no():


    </pre>

    <script>
      function ask(question, yes, no) {
        if (confirm(question)) yes();
        else no();
      }

      function showOk() {
        alert("You agreed.");
      }

      function showCancel() {
        alert("You canceled the execution.");
      }

      // usage: functions showOk, showCancel are passed as arguments to ask
      ask("Do you agree?", showOk, showCancel);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
