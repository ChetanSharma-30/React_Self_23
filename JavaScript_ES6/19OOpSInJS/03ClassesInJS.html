    <h1>Classes In JS</h1>
    <p>Classes are blueprints of an Object. A class can have many Objects because the class is a template while Objects
        are instances of the class or the concrete implementation.</p>
    <p>Before we move further into implementation, we should know unlike other Object Oriented languages there are no
        classes in JavaScript we have only Object. To be more precise, JavaScript is a prototype-based Object Oriented
        Language, which means it doesn’t have classes, rather it defines behaviors using a constructor function and then
        reuses it using the prototype. </p>
    <p><b>Example:</b> Let’s use ES6 classes then we will look at the traditional way of defining an Object and simulate
        them as classes.</p>
    <pre>

                // Defining class using es6
                class Vehicle {
                    constructor(name, maker, engine) {
                        this.name = name;
                        this.maker = maker;
                        this.engine = engine;
                    }
                    getDetails() {
                        return (`The name of the bike is ${this.name}.`)
                    }
                }
                // Making object with the help of the constructor
                let bike1 = new Vehicle('Hayabusa', 'Suzuki', '1340cc');
                let bike2 = new Vehicle('Ninja', 'Kawasaki', '998cc');
                
                console.log(bike1.name);    // Hayabusa
                console.log(bike2.maker);   // Kawasaki
                console.log(bike1.getDetails());
    </pre>
    <p><b>Example:</b> Traditional Way of defining an Object and simulating them as classes.</p>
    <pre>


                // Defining class in a Traditional Way.
                function Vehicle(name, maker, engine) {
                    this.name = name,
                        this.maker = maker,
                        this.engine = engine
                };
                
                Vehicle.prototype.getDetails = function () {
                    console.log('The name of the bike is ' + this.name);
                }
                
                let bike1 = new Vehicle('Hayabusa', 'Suzuki', '1340cc');
                let bike2 = new Vehicle('Ninja', 'Kawasaki', '998cc');
                
                console.log(bike1.name);
                console.log(bike2.maker);
                console.log(bike1.getDetails());
    </pre>
    <p><b>As seen in the above example it is much simpler to define and reuse objects in ES6. Hence, we would be using
            ES6 in all of our examples.</b></p>
