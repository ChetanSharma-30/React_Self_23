    <h1>Abstraction</h1>
    <p>
      <b> Abstraction:</b> Abstraction means displaying only essential
      information and hiding the details. Data abstraction refers to providing
      only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the
      background details or implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes encapsulation refers to the hiding of data or data Abstraction
      which means representing essential features hiding the background detail.
      Most of the OOP languages provide access modifiers to restrict the scope
      of a variable, but there are no such access modifiers in JavaScript, there
      are certain ways by which we can restrict the scope of variables within
      the Class/Object.
    </p>
    <pre>
        

            // Abstraction example
            function person(fname, lname) {
                let firstname = fname;
                let lastname = lname;
            
                let getDetails_noaccess = function () {
                    return (`First name is: ${firstname} Last 
                        name is: ${lastname}`);
                }
            
                this.getDetails_access = function () {
                    return (`First name is: ${firstname}, Last 
                        name is: ${lastname}`);
                }
            }
            let person1 = new person('Mukul', 'Latiyan');
            console.log(person1.firstname);
            console.log(person1.getDetails_noaccess);
            console.log(person1.getDetails_access());
    </pre>
    <p>
      <b>Output:</b> In this example, we try to access some property(person1.firstname)
      and functions(person1.getDetails_noaccess) but it returns undefined while
      there is a method that we can access from the person
      object(person1.getDetails_access()). By changing the way we define a
      function we can restrict its scope.
