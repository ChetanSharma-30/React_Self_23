    <h1>Polymorphism</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Polymorphism:</b> Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of
      object-oriented programming languages. Polymorphism means the same
      function with different signatures is called many times. In real life, for
      example, a boy at the same time may be a student, a class monitor, etc. So
      a boy can perform different operations at the same time. Polymorphism can
      be achieved by method overriding and method overloading
    </p>
    <pre>
        

            // Inheritance example
            class person {
                constructor(name) {
                    this.name = name;
                }
                // method to return the string
                toString() {
                    return (`Name of person: ${this.name}`);
                }
            }
            class student extends person {
                constructor(name, id) {
                    // super keyword for calling the above 
                    // class constructor
                    super(name);
                    this.id = id;
                }
                toString() {
                    return (`${super.toString()},
                    Student ID: ${this.id}`);
                }
            }
            let student1 = new student('Mukul', 22);
            console.log(student1.toString());
    </pre>
    <p>
      <b>Note:</b> The Person and Student objects both have the same method (i.e
      toString()), this is called Method Overriding. <b>Method Overriding</b> allows a
      method in a child class to have the same name(polymorphism) and method
      signature as that of a parent class.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the above code, the super keyword is used to refer to the immediate
      parent classâ€™s instance variable.
