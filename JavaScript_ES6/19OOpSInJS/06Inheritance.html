    <h1>Inheritance</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Inheritance:</b> It is a concept in which some properties and methods
      of an Object are being used by another Object. Unlike most of the OOP
      languages where classes inherit classes, JavaScript Objects inherit
      Objects i.e. certain features (property and methods) of one object can be
      reused by other Objects.

            // Inheritance example
            class person {
                constructor(name) {
                    this.name = name;
                }
                // method to return the string
                toString() {
                    return (`Name of person: ${this.name}`);
                }
            }
            class student extends person {
                constructor(name, id) {
                    // super keyword for calling the above 
                    // class constructor
                    super(name);
                    this.id = id;
                }
                toString() {
                    return (`${super.toString()},
                    Student ID: ${this.id}`);
                }
            }
            let student1 = new student('Mukul', 22);
            console.log(student1.toString());
    </pre>
    <p>
      <b>Output:</b> In this example, we define a Person Object with certain
      properties and methods and then we inherit the Person Object in the
      Student Object and use all the properties and methods of the person Object
      as well as define certain properties and methods for the Student Object.
