    <h1>Closure IN JS</h1>
    <p>
      A closure is a feature of JavaScript that allows inner functions to access
      the outer scope of a function.
    </p>
    <p>
      A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed)
      with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>lexical environment</b> => Lexical in general means in hierarchy or in
      a sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever a new execution context(EC) is created a new lexical environment
      is created and it is referenced in local EC in memory space
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Lexical Environment: Local Memory + Lexical Environment of its
        Parent</strong
      >
    </p>

    <script>
      function outer() {
        var a = "In The Outer Function";
        function inner(params) {
            var b = "In The Global Scope";
            console.log(a);
            function innerInner(params) {
              console.log(b);
            
          }
          innerInner()
        }
        inner();
      }
      outer();
    </script>
